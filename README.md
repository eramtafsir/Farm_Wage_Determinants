# Determinants of Farm Wages: A Mincer Regression Approach
Identified major components of farm wages by analysing trend, patterns and inconsistencies in the National Agricultural Wage Survey (NAWS) data (2009-2018).
Extended the Mincer postulation to include few important variables and see their impact in determining the wage rate.

Based on the results, education, experience, work-type, crop-type and region were selected as the main factors determining the wages in the agricultural market.
